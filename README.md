Ahem its me writing documentation for like the first time in my life
ok so to start install the requirements 
if you cant figure this out, you need both python 3.x and access to the pip module
2. run the read.py file, this will read all serial output as device cannot function without sending data, i hope to improve this later....
finally, run the viaserial.py and edit any functions or shit you would like, yes this all needs to be sudo

goodbye im tired of rigting
